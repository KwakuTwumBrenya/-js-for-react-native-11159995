Array Manipulation and User Info

Student ID: 11159995

Task 1: 
creating 'arrayManipulation.js'
In this i created a JavaScript file named 'arrayManipulation.js'.
I implemented a function named `processArray` which constituted an array of numbers as an argument and returned a new array.
In it, each even number in the array is squared, and each odd number tripled.

Task 2: 
Adding 'formatArrayStrings' to 'arrayManipulation.js'
In 'arrayManipulation.js', i created a function named 'formatArrayStrings'and added it to 'arrray Manipulation.js'.
I made this function take two arrays as argument: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by 'processArray'.
I then wrote a function where i modified each string based on its corresponding number.
I capitalized the string if the number is even and converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.

Task 3: 
Creating 'userInfo.js'
I created a JavaScript file named 'userInfo.js.'
I created a function named 'createUserProfiles' and in its implementation it takes the array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
I Then made the function return an array of objects, each containing 'originalName', 'modifiedName', and 'id' (auto-incrementing starting from 1).
